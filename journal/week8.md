# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

 - Completed the Tasks listed out for the Week. 
 - Got an opportunity to work with AWS CDK, Typescript along with other AWS services at a very detailed level to serve an image through the application. 
 - As always, ChatGPT and Bootcampers on Discord once again helped me to get through this week.
 - I am now able to appreciate the high that developers gets on seeing a deployment/feature work and then ultimately seeing the application work.


 ### Implement CDK to deploy an Serverless Image processing Solution
 
 - Used CDK to do the following
 
 -   Create a S3 Bucket cloudnoww-cruddur-uploaded-avatars for storing the original uploaded avatar images ( ex.data.jpg).
 -   Create a  Lambda fn -ThumbLambda to process the uploaded images in the S3 Bucket cloudnoww-cruddur-uploaded-avatars and stores the final processed image (data.jpg)
     into the folder - avatars of the manually created S3 bucket - assets.cloudnoww.com from which the processed images are served in the profile page of cruddur app.

ctoring of scripts and making the code user friendly was a great experience but extremely heavy one for me who has a Zero background in coding. 
 - ChatGPT and Bootcampers on Discord once again helped me to get through this week.
 - As they say, the proof of pudding is in eating and using my own domain name to access Cruddur application was a highlight for me.
