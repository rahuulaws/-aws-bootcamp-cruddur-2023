### Update  

Completed the checklist and have made a living document to capture the Personal Learnings from each Week, starting Week-2.

Looked up the Open Telemetry documentation on Observability and an E-books on "Observability" from Dynatrace.
Could not complete the X-ray Instrumentation along with X Ray subsegments but hope to complete it the coming week.
