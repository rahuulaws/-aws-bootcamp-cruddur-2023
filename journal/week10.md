# Week 10 and Week 11 â€” CloudFormation

 - Completed the Tasks listed out for the CFN Week. 
 - It was a fabulous opportunity to work handson with CFN for deploying multiple AWS services. I could not have asked for more.
 - This was the the only week, where I did not need to take support from my fellow Bootcampers and ChatGPT at a very minimal level.


### Context and Background 
 
  - The objective of this Two week is to use the Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) Service : AWS Cloudformation Tool to create AWS Infrastructure and deploy the Cruddur application on it.
  - Cloudformation helps us to define the desired cloud environment using code writen in either Yaml or Json, known as templates, instead of manually configuring each resource.
  - The key benefits for using AWS Cloudformation can be listed  as below : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
    - Simplify infrastructure management
    - Quickly replicate your infrastructure
    - Easily control and track changes to your infrastructure
   - Do note we have used YAML script to write the AWS Cloudformation templates
   - Each AWS Service/Infrastructure was created and deployed by creating a folder structure in the AWS trre in our Gitpod environment.
   - As an representation I am showing the snapshot of the template for the ECS Cluster creation, detail steps such as folder creation in Gitpod which stores the template in yaml and in another folder
     a Bash Script for AWS CLI to initiate the deployment of AWS Cloudformation of template,which would not be done for other services that we deploy using CFN.

 
 ### Create a ECS Cluster using Cloudformation template - Completed in the first episode with the AWS Guest.
 
   - We started off by creating a folder named cfn under AWS in our Gitpod environment with a template.yaml stored in it. 
   - This Cloudformation template as below would create the ECS Cluster
   
   ![ECSTemplate](https://github.com/rahuulaws/-aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/77395830/35bb5168-5393-46d1-abe7-c286f6b4715c)
   
   - A bash script is used to to deploy the the cloudformation template with aws cli command and the same is stored in the path ./bin/cfn/deploy and the final copy of the template stored 
     in an S3 bucket : cfn-artifacts-cloud-bootcamp

   - We are expected to review the changset in the AWS Cloudformation console which will depict the changes that have been applied to the resources before the changeset is executed.
   - AWS Cloudformation Console details as below

 ### Network Layer using Cloudformation template
 
 - We started off by creating a Networking folder under cfn with the path aws/cfn/networking
 - Created CFN template and put in the above path to deploy VPC, IGW, AttachIGW, RouteTable, RouteToIGW, public and private Subnets, SubnetRTAssociation and outputs.
 - Config.toml file which has key configuration details such as the name of the stack - CrdNet, region of deployment, S3 Bucketname details are referenced by the CFN template.
 - Bash script kept under the path ./bin/cfn/networking is run which deploys the CFN template with aws cli command.

### AWS Lambda, Dynamodb and DynamoDB Streams using Serverless Application Module(SAM) Cloudformation template

 - We started off by creating a DDB folder under cfn with the path aws/cfn/ddb
 - Created CFN template and put in the above path to deploy the following
   - The primary Postgres RDS Database for the application
     - DynamoDB Table
     - DynamoDB Stream
     - LambdaLogGroup
     - ExecutionRole for lambda
 - SAM is installed in Gitpod and Gitpod.yml
 - AWS Serverless Application Model - Build serverless applications in simple and clean syntax : https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/
    - The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.
    - With just a few lines per resource, one can define the application they want and model it using YAML.
    - During deployment, SAM transforms and expands the SAM syntax into AWS CloudFormation syntax, enabling one to build serverless applications faster.
    - Use the AWS SAM CLI or AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to start building SAM-based applications.
    - One can also use the SAM CLI to deploy applications to AWS, or create secure CI/CD pipelines that follow best practices and integrate with AWS.
 - Bash script is created for SAM Build, SAM PACKAGE and SAM DEPLOY
 - create a bash script file to sam build, sam package and sam deploy
 
 ![SAM Scripts](https://github.com/rahuulaws/-aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/assets/77395830/a75ac822-8d4d-404e-b398-a076d43c0c64)
 
 - Run the bash script - ./ddb/build ; ./ddb/package and ./ddb/deploy to get the following outputs.
