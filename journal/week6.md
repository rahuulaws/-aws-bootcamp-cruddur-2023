# Week 6 â€” Deploying Containers

## Required Homework

 - Completed the Tasks listed out. 
 - This Week was a good example of using various different AWS Services and getting them to work together : ECR and ECS, R53, ACM, ALB and Custom Domain name.
 - The Refactoring of scripts and making the code user friendly was a great experience but extremely heavy one for me who has a Zero background in coding. 
 - ChatGPT and Bootcampers on Discord once again helped me to get through this week.
 - As they say, the proof of pudding is in eating and using my own domain name to access Cruddur application was a highlight for me.
