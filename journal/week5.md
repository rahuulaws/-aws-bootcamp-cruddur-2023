# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

## Required Homework

 - Completed the Tasks listed out. 
 - Worked extensively on Dynamodb in development and production environment along with AWS Lambda as a service using AWS Console and command line.
 - Creation of Global Secondary Index along with DynamoDB stream to Capture item-level changes in Cruddur-messages table, and push the changes to a DynamoDB stream.
 - Integration of Dynamodb with AWS Lambda through the Use of triggers by invoking an AWS Lambda function every time an item is changed, and then our DynamoDB stream 
   is updated was one of the key steps in this segment, even though it took very less time.
 - Probably the first Networking Service used in this Bootcamp through the Deployment of VPC Endpoint : Gateway Endpoint to access Production DynamoDB through the
   AWS Console.
 - Finally, Implementing conversations though was a application focussed task, it was a very satisfying task to see a first glimpse of the functionality of what the 
   Cruddur will eventually do and for me it was a highlight of the 5th week. 

 - ChatGPT and Bootcampers on Discord helped me to get through this week.

 - I onboarded Captain Spock and Jason Bourne on my team, by creating an Identity for them in the Cruddur DB. Helps to have problem solver's in my team : Just Kidding :)
